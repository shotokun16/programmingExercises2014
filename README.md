programmingExercises2014
========================
Good evening ladies and gentleman:

ProgrammingExercises2014 is a to do bucket list for my 2014 career change (i.e. government to programming/computerscience/softwareDev)  I would like to dedicate this repository for prepping for some computer science classes for the spring of 2014 and other personal goals to finally grasp Algorithms and Programming with Logic and Design.  Most(majority) of these exercises will originate from:

  "Starting out with >>> Programming Logic and Design" by Tony Gaddis (3rd edition) 
  Copyright 2013, 2010, 2008 by Pearson Education, Inc., publishing as Addison-Wesely. 
  All Rights Reserved.  
  
And a majority of them will be written in C++, Java, and hopefully PHP.  I'll also create a psuedo code and try to get in five problems every 2-days and hopefully complete ten problems a week (beginning 2/7/14-TBD).  Feel free to chime in and point out flaws or errors in my pseudo or coding process.  

Cheers
